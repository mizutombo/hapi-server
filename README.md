# hapi-server

*  For the Different Server Side Framework bonus assignment, I used Hapi to refactor my Express-Mongo-Resources assignment. <br/>

*  In an attempt to get this to mesh with Hapi's server framework, I had to eliminate and / or refactor some of my original code. <br/>

*  I tried to preserve as much of my original code as possible, but still had to make considerable changes to keep Hapi happy. <br/>

*  As of 1/14/2017 @ time 13:40, I am still in process of debugging my code, but submitting current code for evaluation. <br/>

** 1/14/2017 @ time 21:05 ... starting new branch 'hapi-debug-punt' for last ditch effort ** <br/>

*  Refactor per strict framework guidelines of Hapi ... using Hapi eco-systems node packages 'boom' for error-handling, and 'joi' for schema validation ... also added node package 'node-uuid' for generating unique ids. <br/>

* As of 1/14/2017 @ time 23:40, I have completed refactoring of code to align more with hapi framework. However, I am still getting errors ... i.e. hapi does appear to like 'mongoose' ... failing all REST-api tests. <br/>

* Re-submitting as alternative approach to resolving this code. <br/>
