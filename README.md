# hapi-server

*  For the Different Server Side Framework bonus assignment, I used Hapi to refactor my Express-Mongo-Resources assignment. <br/>

*  In an attempt to get this to mesh with Hapi's server framework, I had to eliminate and / or refactor some of my original code. <br/>

*  I tried to preserve as much of my original code as possible, but still had to make considerable changes to keep Hapi happy. <br/>

*  As of 1/14/2017 @ time 13:40, I am still in process of debugging my code, but submitting current code for evaluation. <br/>
